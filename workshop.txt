description=[h1]What does this mod do ?[/h1]
description=The goal of this mod is to make the two mods [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3006143351]Cordyceps Spore Zones[/url] from Braven and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2795677303]Susceptible[/url] from Spyjack work together. It is partially inspired by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3035924033]TLOU Enhanced Experience[/url] from Monkey which is broken at the time of writing this.

description=You are [b]in a spore zone without any protection[/b] ! You will [b]get infected[/b] if you don't get out now !
description=
description=The time for infection depends on the settings of the original Spore Zone mod and can be changed in the sandbox options. You will also become sick when in the spore zone without a protection, it's a neat indicator that you can also use.

description=This means you are [b]not[/b] in a spore zone and [b]don't have a gasmask or hazmat equiped[/b]. Make sure you equip one of those before going in a spore zone ! 
description=
description=You can [b]find a gasmask or hazmat[/b] to protect yourself on [b]various zombies[/b] or you can [b]loot it[/b] in some places. But don't forget the [b]filter or oxygen tank[/b] or it won't work ![/td]

description=The durability of the protection is [b]only drained in spore zones[/b] so you can stay cool and styled with your gasmask even outside without draining your protection's durability.
